Most of the time, you will want to specify S = SquareMatrix{T}.\n\nArrays & Strings\n\nGeneral purpose generators for arrays and strings are a little bit tricky to implement given that a length for each sampled element must be specified. The following choices have been made for the default generators shipped with this package:\n\nString: The length of each string is approximately exponentially distributed with mean 64.\nArray{T, N}: The length of each dimension of a given array is approximately exponentially distributed with mean 24 ÷ N + 1 (in a low effort attempt to keep the number of entries manageable).\n\nIf this is not appropriate for your needs, don't hesitate to reimplement generate.\n\nImplementation\n\nWhen implementing generate for your type T keep the following in mind:\n\nYour method should return a Vector{T}\nIt is not necessary to write generate(T, n) or generate([rng, ]Array{T, N}, n) where N; this is handled automatically. You only need to implement generate(::AbstractRNG, ::Type{T}, ::Int)\nConsider implementing specialcases and shrink for T as well.\n\nExamples\n\nusing Random: Xoshiro\n\nrng = Xoshiro(42)\n\ngenerate(rng, Float32, 10)\n\n# output\n\n10-element Vector{Float32}:\n -1.5388016f7\n -5.3113024f-19\n -1.3960648f35\n  1.5957566f31\n -4.381218f26\n  2.380078f35\n  3.878954f9\n -1.1950524f-7\n  7.525897f24\n -3.1891005f-12\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"reference/#JCheck.specialcases-Tuple{Type}","page":"Reference","title":"JCheck.specialcases","text":"specialcases(T)\n\nNon-random inputs that are always checked by @quickcheck.\n\nArguments\n\nT::Type: type of the inputs.\n\nImplementation\n\nYour method should return a Vector{T}\nUseless without a generate method for T.\nBe mindful of combinatoric explosion! @quickcheck generate an input for each element of the Cartesian product of the special cases of every arguments of the predicates it is trying to falsify.
